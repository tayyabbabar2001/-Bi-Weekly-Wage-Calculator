# Bi-Weekly-Wage-Calculator
The Bi-Weekly Wage Calculator is a C++ program designed to help users calculate their total earnings for a two-week pay period. Users input their hourly rate, regular working hours, and overtime hours for each week, and the program calculates their total bi-weekly wages, including regular pay and overtime pay.


**Features:**

Hourly Rate Input: The program prompts the user to enter their hourly rate.

Week 1 and Week 2 Inputs: Users are asked to provide their working hours and overtime hours for both Week 1 and Week 2.

Calculation: The calculator computes the regular wages and overtime wages for both weeks based on the entered hourly rate. It then adds up the total wages for the two-week period, considering both regular and overtime pay.

**How to Use:**

Run the program.
Enter your hourly rate when prompted by the console.
Enter the working hours and overtime hours for Week 1 as requested.
Similarly, enter the working hours and overtime hours for Week 2.
The program will process the input and display the total bi-weekly wages.
**Note:**

The Bi-Weekly Wage Calculator assumes the user will input valid positive numerical values for hourly rate, working hours, and overtime hours.
Overtime hours are considered at 1.75 times the regular hourly rate.
